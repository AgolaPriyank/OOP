//Polymorphism => Many ways to represent
//Two Types of Polymorphism => 1)Compile Time Polymorphism 2)Run Time Polymorphism
//Compile Time / Static => Overloading 
//Run Time / Dynamic => Overriding
//A method is overridden, not the data members, so runtime polymorphism can't be achieved by data members.
